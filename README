I think this code is working but didn't test it.
I published a version a long time ago and I don't know if I changed something before pushing it to Github. 
Sorry if it crashes...
It was my first android app so I think the code isn't perfect. ;)


It's a simple Android application, currently on the Market: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.gp2mv3.mines

The app under the Creative Commons by-nc (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) so feel free to share or modify it, when the sources will be there, it's going to be easyer. ;)
